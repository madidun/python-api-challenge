# python-api-challenge


Project Overview: In this project we used API keys from Open Weather Map to create plots. We were able to show and compare linear relationships between plots. Some of the scatter plots had similiar linear relationships. I initially had problems with the linear regression but after a lot of trial and error I was able to get the r value. I eventually was able to get the different plots after adjusting the data differently to fit the requirements. In VacationPy I was able to use geoviews to get the map plots. After filtering the data we were able to narrow down the hotels. At the end there were no hotels found for the cities that fit the requirements.
